# graphqlRestaurantActivity
A local collection of restaurant data and the GraphQL queries used to target that data

## What is it?
In this challenge, we were tasked to use GraphQL to query data in a local database. This was an exercise to help us become more familiar with GraphQL. The data includes restaurants with ids, names, descriptions, and dishes, which also include a name and price.

## What I Found Challenging
The biggest challenge in the GraphQL exercises was defining the correct terminology to edit and delete items from my 'database'. Once I identified the process it became significantly easier.

## What I Would Differently In The Future
I would really love to try this using a database of some kind. I found this to be fairly easy because all of the data was viewable within the file. I would love to play around with data that I can't see so that I get a better feel of creating effective queries.
